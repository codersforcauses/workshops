After these installation, seek at the OS-specific tools.

### Windows
These are tools specifically for Windows:

- Virtual Machine: Vbox
    - You need this if you have some trouble with windows

??? warning "Warning for Windows Users"
    Legit, among all the OS, you will have the most frustrating time as a developer in windows (unless you're doing C#)

??? tip "Wanna have a better developer experience"
    You have a couple of options:

    - Using WSL
    - Dual Booting
    - Virtual Machines

    The recommended OS to try is Ubuntu-based Linux. My personal favourite is PopOS.
