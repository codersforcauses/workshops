# Coders for Causes 2021/22 Summer Workshops

This project period continues the two main projects from the winter of 2020 :

- [Foodbank](https://github.com/codersforcauses/foodbank)
- [WAIS](https://github.com/codersforcauses/wais)

If you have not before seen the existing progress, see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXT595PxvU).

These two projects have their own corresponding technology stacks being used, hence will dictate the workshops that will be held.

## Project Technology

### Foodbank
Foodbank is mainly with frontend with React + TailwindCSS with Firebase and Notion CMS.

### WAIS
WAIS is a full-stack application with Vue and Django. It uses Docker containerisation for both development (and production in the future).

## Workshop Recordings
The workshop recordings will be held on our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp47I0qUXeGgSK0AtFJSkbQ).
