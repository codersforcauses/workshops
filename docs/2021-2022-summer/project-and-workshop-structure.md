# Project and Workshop Structure
*A mission to empower the next-generation of software engineers and delivering value to the community!*

## Ways of Working

- (November 27 to February 24 excluding December 19 to January 4) = ~ 11 weeks for project
- 2 meetups every week (1 online mid-week, 1 on Saturday)

- Each Saturday meeting will have ~2-3 hour workshops. Some workshops will take the whole hour, while some workshops will take 15-30 minutes.
- The other time allocated is for working on project with supervision
- Most workshops will be introductory

## Workshop Schedule

The following are rough guideline to the workshop schedules. All workshops are optional, you can attend any of them even if you are not on the specific team dedicated to it (be mindful that there may be time conflicts if it is with the other team).

??? note "Most Workshops are introductory"
    They will usually cover the following idea:

    - why is it useful to learn it
    - what are the different aspects of it that you will need to learn

    **You will still have to put in the effort to learn it thoroughly.**
