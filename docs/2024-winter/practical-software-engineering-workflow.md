## How do software engineers work?
They use **issue/ticket management system** to track their work.

???+ example "Github Issues and Jira"
    The examples are Github Issues and Jira.

### Git Different Versions

??? info "Software Versions"
    ![versioning](images/versioning.png){align=left}

**Nodes**
- Representation of a change (commits + merge)

**Main/Master:**
- Branch usually as production or deployed

**Development Branch**
- Branch used for development
Used for compiling features for a release

**Feature Branch**
- Branch used for development for a
particular issue

## GitHub and Code Repositories

**GitHub**
- Place to hold code repositories

**Repositories**
- Place where codes are stored with different versions


## INTERACTIVE WORKSHOP TIME !!!!
1. Do the following from [codersforcauses/software-engineering-practices-demo](https://github.com/codersforcauses/software-engineering-practices-demo-2024-winter): Demonstration of software engineering practices (github.com):
2. Look at the GitHub issues
3. Assign yourself an issue
4. Clone repo with `git clone https://github.com/codersforcauses/software-engineering-practices-demo-2024-winter.git`
5. Create a branch with the following format s{Issue Number}-{Issue Name}. `git checkout -b {Issue Number}-{Issue Name}`
6. Create the change to satisfy or complete the github issue
7. Commit (package) the change `git commit -m "{insert message here}"` and push git push.
8. Create a pull request and request for a reviewer from CFC peeps
