# Coders for Causes 2021/22 Summer Workshops

This project period continues the two main projects from the winter of 2020 :

- [WADL](https://github.com/codersforcauses/wadl)
- [POOPS](https://github.com/codersforcauses/poops)

If you have not before seen the existing progress, see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXT595PxvU).

These two projects have their own corresponding technology stacks being used, hence will dictate the workshops that will be held.

## Project Technology

### POOPS
POOPS is a web-app built the frontend with React + NextJS + TypeScript + TailwindCSS with Firebase and Notion CMS.

### WADL
WADL is a full-stack application with Vue and Firebase. It uses Docker containerisation for both development (and production in the future).

## Workshop Recordings
The workshop recordings will be held on our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@codersforcauses230).
