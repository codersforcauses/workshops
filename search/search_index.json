If those plugin don't exist, then it limits your productivity very much (difficulty to extend). CMS are usually built to cater for non-technical users. This means that thye become the subject of hackers. Think about a scenario where a hacker was able to find a vulnerability in WordPress, now every other WordPress site will be vulnerable. What is the best way to learn all these? \u00b6 In summary, the best way to learn: Do personal projects (inspiration + motivation) Do team projects (get peer reviews and correct bad practices straight away) Watch Online Courses (to figure out what is available) More Information To be told that you have to learn \"this, this, and that\" before you could do things is tiresome. Often times, we want to learn to be a developer so that we can create cool things like software where thousands of people can use the app. We don't tend to be a developer for the sake of us needing to watch endless videos on different things. Why does CFC not do mobile development as much as web development? \u00b6 App stores has a developer cost Easier to deal/teach web technologies Accessibility (mobile, sensors, tablets, laptops and PCs) Bigger open-source community If I already know a frontend framework, is it better to learn another frontend framework or to learn a backend framework? \u00b6 It is better to learn a backend framework Reasoning You want to build skills that complement one another rather than be an alternative. It is much more valuable for you to learn a backend framework because that helps you build a functional app. Basics of Web and Limitation \u00b6 HTML What is it?

Github Action, Bitbucket Pipelines Virtualisation and Containerisation \u00b6 Allows execution of services in a virtual environment eg. Docker (Containerisation), Vagrant (Virtualisation) Browsers \u00b6 Standard browsers Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc. Backwards compatibility Internet Explorer Other Mobile - Responsive Screen readers - Accessibility Firefox Developer Tools \u00b6 Page Inspector Visualise page aspects Grid layout Web Console console.log(\u201cHello World\u201d) Responsive Design Mode View from POV of different screen sizes such as mobile, tablets, etc. Some more tools: - JavaScript Debugger - Network Monitor - Performance Tools - Rulers - Colour Pickers Learn more at: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools Package Managers \u00b6 Installs libraries that can be used Also has code shortcuts (e.g. npm run start) (More about package.json and poetry.toml in the projects and Package Manager Workshop) Version Control \u00b6 Essential for developer teams and complex software development Git Linters and Formatters \u00b6 Makes code formatting consistent (following standard) Useful with version controls to avoid pointless change eg.ESLint, Prettier Teamwork \u00b6 Many tools out there Used to stop teams from stepping on each others toes Github Issues + Pull Requests Roadmaps \u00b6 There's an open-source community that maintains a learning roadmap for developers. See https://roadmap.sh/ Frontend Developer Backend Developer Dev-Ops Word of Encouragement \u00b6 Encouragement from the Tech Lead \"I can admit that this journey of learning will be difficult, and can sometimes be overwhelming and demotivating. Please, if at any point of this project, you feel that you don't know enough, or you're feeling lost, please reach out! We are all in this journey together! Nobody is born talented, skills are honed with determination and willingness to learn.\" \"When I was a first year student entering on the CFC winter project, I didn't feel like I was good enough. I couldn't create a good looking interface, I didn't know how to use npm and all sorts of those things. I was just like many of you! if I gave up just because of all those things I didn't know, of all those self-doubts, then I wouldn't be here today. I admit that I was lucky because I was in CFC, I had connections where I can just ask questions instead of feeling lost of not knowing. So please do leverage that opportunity to reach out\" \"You being in this project not only gives you the opportunity to raise your talents, but you also unlock one of the biggest factor of the growth of your career, and that is the connections with your fellow software engineers.\"","title":"Introduction to Web Development"},{"location":"2021-2022-summer/introduction-to-web-development/#introduction-to-web-development-space","text":"Navigating the Deep Dark Space of Web Development This workshop covers a brief overview of the most common tools and technologies used in web development.","title":"Introduction to Web Development Space"},{"location":"2021-2022-summer/introduction-to-web-development/#content","text":"What and Why Web Development?

Nobody is born talented, skills are honed with determination and willingness to learn.\" \"When I was a first year student entering on the CFC winter project, I didn't feel like I was good enough. I couldn't create a good looking interface, I didn't know how to use npm and all sorts of those things. I was just like many of you! if I gave up just because of all those things I didn't know, of all those self-doubts, then I wouldn't be here today. I admit that I was lucky because I was in CFC, I had connections where I can just ask questions instead of feeling lost of not knowing.
