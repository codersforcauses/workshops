Once you have installed Python, install mkdocs requirements by opening a terminal and typing: 1 pip install -r requirements.txt Python Environments (Optional) however, it is good practice to use different environments for different purposes, in which case, for Anaconda, you would open a terminal and type: 1 2 conda create -n mkdocstutorial python conda activate mkdocstutorial then enter: 1 pip install -r requirements.txt Docker \u00b6 Just run docker-compose up , it should show the web server running at localhost:8000 Commands \u00b6 mkdocs new [dir-name] - Create a new project. mkdocs serve - Start the live-reloading docs server.
